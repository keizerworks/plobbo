        you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (&quot;you&quot;), and
        Keizerworks, concerning your access to and use of the Services. You
        agree that by accessing the Services, you have read, understood, and
        agreed to be bound by all of these Legal Terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH

      </p>

      <p>
        Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the
        Services from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by
        reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes
        or modifications to these Legal Terms at any time and for any reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will alert you about any changes by updating the &quot;Last
        Updated&quot; date of these Legal Terms, and you waive any right to
        receive specific notice of each such change. It is your responsibility
        to periodically review these Legal Terms to stay informed of updates.
        You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of
        and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Legal Terms by your
        continued use of the Services after the date such revised Legal Terms
        are posted.
      </p>
      <p>
        All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside
        (generally under the age of 18) must have the permission of, and be

      <h2>1. OUR SERVICES</h2>
      <p>
        The information provided when using the Services is not intended for
        distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or
        country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
        regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement
        within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who
        choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own
        initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if
        and to the extent local laws are applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific
        regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
        (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so
        if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use
        the Services. You may not use the Services in a way that would violate
        the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

      <ul>
        <li>No arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding;</li>

        Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of
        this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute
        shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts

        If any provision or part of a provision of these Legal Terms is
        determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or
        part of the provision is deemed severable from these Legal Terms and
        does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
        provisions.
