      <h3>If You Are Located in Canada, This Section Applies to You</h3>

      <p>
        We may process your information if you have given us specific permission
        (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific
        purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e.,

        example:
      </p>

      <ul>

        <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>

        <li>
          If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would
          compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the
          collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a
          breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a

      <p>
        Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
        third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X
        logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile

        concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends
        list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to
        make public on such a social media platform.
      </p>

      <p>

        described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you
        on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are
        not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your
        third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their

        otherwise required by law.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period
        of time in which users have an account with us.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.

        organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
        personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
        efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
        Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
        secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals,
        or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
        security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
        information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
        information, transmission of personal information to and from our
        Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within

        under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal
        information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least

        will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
        delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we

        greater access to and control over your personal information. You may
        review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your
        country, province, or state of residence.
      </p>

      <p>
        In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have
        certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include
        the right:
      </p>

        </li>

        <li>If applicable, to data portability</li>
        <li>Not to be subject to automated decision-making</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the
        processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by
        contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section
        <Link href="#15-how-can-you-contact-us-about-this-notice">
          HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?
        </Link>{" "}
        below.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable
        data protection laws.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully
        processing your personal information, you also have the right to
        complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data
        protection authority.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data
        Protection and Information Commissioner.
      </p>

      <h3>Withdrawing Your Consent</h3>
      <p>
        If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information,
        which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable
        law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can
        withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact
        details provided in the section
        <Link href="#15-how-can-you-contact-us-about-this-notice">
          HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?
        </Link>
        below or updating your preferences.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
        processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will
        it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
        reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
      </p>

      <h3>Opting Out of Marketing and Promotional Communications</h3>
      <p>
        You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at
        any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send,
        or by contacting us using the details provided in the section
        <Link href="#15-how-can-you-contact-us-about-this-notice">
          HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?
        </Link>{" "}
        below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we
        may still communicate with you — for example, to send you
        service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and
        use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other
        non-marketing purposes.
      </p>

      <h3>Account Information</h3>
      <p>
        If you would at any time like to review or change the information in
        your account or terminate your account, you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or
        delete your account and information from our active databases. However,
        we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud,
        troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal
        terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.
      </p>

      <h3>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>
      <p>
        Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer,
        you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to
        reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this
        could affect certain features or services of our Services.

      <h2>12. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting
        you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
        about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this
        stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
        DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
        DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
        communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
        online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
        inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy
        Notice.
      </p>

      <p>
        California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser
        DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal
        standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to
        them at this time.
