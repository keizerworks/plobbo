        you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("you"), and
        Keizerworks, concerning your access to and use of the Services. You
        agree that by accessing the Services, you have read, understood, and
        agreed to be bound by all of these Legal Terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH
        ALL OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING
        THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.
      </p>
      <p>
        Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the
        Services from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by
        reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes
        or modifications to these Legal Terms at any time and for any reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date
        of these Legal Terms, and you waive any right to receive specific notice
        of each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically review
        these Legal Terms to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to,
        and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the
        changes in any revised Legal Terms by your continued use of the Services

        All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside

      <h2>1. OUR SERVICES</h2>
      <p>
        The information provided when using the Services is not intended for
        distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or
        country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
        regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement
        within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who
        choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own
        initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if
        and to the extent local laws are applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific
        regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
        (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so
        if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use
        the Services. You may not use the Services in a way that would violate
        the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).

      <h3>Informal Negotiations</h3>
      <p>
        To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy,
        or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a "Dispute" and
        collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually,
        a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties agree to first
        attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly
        provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before
        initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written
        notice from one Party to the other Party.
      </p>

      <h3>Binding Arbitration</h3>
      <p>
        Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Legal Terms,
        including any question regarding its existence, validity, or
        termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by the
        International Commercial Arbitration Court under the European
        Arbitration Chamber (Belgium, Brussels, Avenue Louise, 146) according to
        the Rules of this ICAC, which, as a result of referring to it, is
        considered as part of this clause. The number of arbitrators shall be
        three (3). The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be Haryana,
        India. The language of the proceedings shall be English. The governing
        law of these Legal Terms shall be the substantive law of India.
      </p>

      <h3>Restrictions</h3>
      <p>
        The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
        between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding;</li>
        <li>
          There is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a
          class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures;
        </li>
        <li>
          There is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
          purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or
          any other persons.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h3>
      <p>
        The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
        above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding
        arbitration:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity
          of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party;
        </li>
        <li>
          Any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy,
          invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use;
        </li>
        <li>Any claim for injunctive relief.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither
        Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of
        this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute
        shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts
        listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the
        personal jurisdiction of that court.
